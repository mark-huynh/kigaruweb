## Introduction
This website was built for the Kigaru Sushi restaurant located in Beaverton, Oregon. Accompanied with a serverless MongoDB and AWS backend, this website dynamically renders content from the data that is manipulated from this [management repo](https://github.com/mark-huynh/kigaru-manager).

## Features

Website was first developed during the summer of 2019 as a completely static site with updates only being done via Git with a Electron GUI. In 2020, I decided to integrate a backend and the details can be found in the management repo linked in the intro. 


This webpage renders its content dynamically and is cross platform compatible for both mobile and desktop. Webpage utilizes client side routing, so data is only fetched once after a user enters the page or hard refreshes.
